#### Reasons why we need GFS
1.  Failures could be very normal because there would be thousands of machines and clients running at the same time.
2.  Files are huge by traditional standard.
3.  Most files are mutated by appending new data rather than overwriting existing data.
4.  Co-designing the applications and the file system API benefits the overall system by increasing our flexibility.


## Architecture
*  single **master**
*  multiple **chunkservers**
*  multiple **clients**

    Clients never read and write file data through the master. Instead, a client asks the master which chunkservers it should contact. It caches this information for a limited time and interacts with chunkservers directly for many subsequent operations.

## Chunk Size
64MB, which is much larger than typical file system block sizes.

#### advantages
-  It reduces clients' need to interact with the master
-  A client is more likely to perform many operations on a given chunk, it can reduce network overhead by keeping a persistent TCP connection to the chunkserver over an extended period of time.
-  It reduces the size of the metadata stored on the master.

#### disadvantages
-  A small file consists of a small number of chunks, perhaps just one.

## Metadata
The master stores three major types of metadata.
-  the file and chunk namespaces
-  the mapping from files to chunks
-  the locations of each chunk's replicas

1. All metadata is kept in master's **memory**.
2. The first two types (namespaces and file-to-chunk mapping) are also kept persistent by logging mutations to an operation log stored on the masterâ€™s local disk and replicated on remote machines. Using a log allows us to update the master state simply, reliably, and without risking inconsistencies in the event of a master crash.
3. The master does not store chunk location information persistently. Instead, it asks each chunkserver about its chunks at master startup and whenever a chunkserver joins the cluster.

Keeping operation log is a very important strategy to ensure that all chunkservers sync correctly.

## Consistency Model
1. state of a file region after a data mutation depends on
    - the type of mutation
    - whether it succeeds or fails
    - whether there are concurrent mutations
2. after a sequence of successfull mutations
    - applying mutations to a chunk in the same order on all its replicas
    - using chunk version numbers to detect any replica that has become stale
